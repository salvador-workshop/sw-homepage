# About Me

I'm a front-end developer and aspiring designer from Toronto, Canada. With over six years of professional dev experience, I'm comfortable with using many types of software tools to build a proper solution. In addition, I tend to work well with designers and artists when collaborating on visuals.

When I'm away from work, I'm usually playing guitar, training at a climbing gym, or designing something to satisfy my curiosity. More recently, I've set my sights on architecture. It's a broad field, and feels like a space where I can put all my skills to their best use.
