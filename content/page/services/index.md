### Brand style guide

Brand style guides are documents that specify and establish visual standards for your brand. A solid style guide allows your brand to have consistent visuals on advertisement, websites, social media profiles, etc.

Having a style guide done is useful if you’re ok with applying the styling yourself, or know someone who can. Style guides are also handy as documentation. For example, a style spec gives future designers an easier time with updating your brand by giving them context for design decisions.
