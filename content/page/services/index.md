### Brand asset formatting

A well-formatted package of images and media. Useful if you already have assets for your brand, but need those assets reworked into specific file formats, sizes, or for certain platforms.

Style guides are also handy as documentation. For example, a style spec gives future designers an easier time with updating your brand by giving them context for design decisions.
